<h1>Importing AviSys stream files</h1>
<p>In case you are not familiar with importing data via an AviSys stream file, here is a quick tutorial.
Once you have downloaded your stream file, possibly accompanied by a field notes file,
use AviSys to perform the steps listed below.
Note: An AviSys stream file has an extension of .str.
It may be accompanied by a field notes file, which has the same filename but an extension of .fnr.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Switch to world mode.</li>
<li>Click File->Sighting Record Streaming->Read Stream from File...</li>
<li>Use the Windows explorer dialog to find your stream file and select it.</li>
<li>AviSys will display a series of message boxes that you will have to dismiss.
If all is going well, these messages will be
<ol style="list-style:lower-alpha">
<li>This file passes the Version 6 Stream File test.</li>
<li>Stream File loaded into Sighting Stream.</li>
<li>That means it's just loaded into memory. It has not been added to your sighting file.</li>
<li>To add these records to your sighting file you must use "Import Records From Stream".</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Optional: You can press F8 to have a quick look at your data that is ready to import.</li>
<li>Click File->Sighting Record Streaming->Import Records From Stream...</li>
<li>Again, Avisys will display a series of message boxes that you will have to dismiss.
If all is going well, these messages will be
<ol style="list-style:lower-alpha">
<li>All records checked OK - ready to import...</li>
<li>OK to add ___ sighting records to your sighting file? (Click Yes)</li>
<li>Confirm each of ___ records before importing? (Click Yes or No)</li>
</ol>
<p>If you choose to confirm each record, AviSys will present them one at a time,
and you can edit them as you go, or choose to skip certain records.
This may sometimes be useful but it gets quite tedious for a long list.</p>
<p>If you choose not to confirm each record, they will all be immediately loaded
and you can go to the Journal to review and edit them.</p>
</li>
<li>If your imported list includes any life birds, or any species new to any of your checklists,
you will need to run <strong>Utilities-&gt;Set Checklist Markers</strong> after importing.
</li>
</ol>
