<h1>Bug report</h1>
<p>Until 8 March 2017, there was a minor bug in this application, affecting 
sightings from outside the 48 US states.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong>
AviSys defines 20 high-level reporting areas that are listed in the Places table under the Continents tab.
Some of these are actual continents, such as Eurasia, some are oceans, and others are just listing areas,
such as [ABA Area] and [Lower 48]. Unlike the other levels of places (Sites, Cities, Counties, States, Nations),
a given sighting can belong under multiple "continents".
For example, a single sighting can simultaneously belong to the "continents" of North America, [ABA Area], [Lower 48], [US], and [AOU].
The Continent classification can be inferred from the Nation, and until March 2017, I did not understand that
the Continent classification is also cleverly hidden in the data stream.
Consequently, I erroneously classified every sighting as being from the Lower 48 states of the US.</p>
<p><strong>Consequences:</strong> The effects of the bug are limited to just two areas, and only appear for sightings from outside the Lower 48.
First, if you ever run reports or listings at the continent level, they will not include the correct sightings.
This does not apply to reports or listings of Sites, Cities, Counties, States, or Nations; they are correct. 
Only Continent-level reports or lists will have the error.
Second, the number displayed on the main AviSys screen as "seen in ABA Area" will incorrectly include species from
outside the ABA Area.</p>
<p><strong>Repairing data:</strong> If you have data that has been corrupted by this error, it is very easily corrected.
Switch to World Mode, and
under the Utilities menu, click on "Certify Data Set Quality".
Click "OK" on the series of messages.
Then when it asks "Would you now like to scan your sightings for proper Nation/Continent codes?" click "Yes" and then "Start", and then when it finishes click "OK" and "Done".
This is the important part and it will completely correct your data.</p>
<p><strong>No more bug:</strong> The bug is now fixed, but for correct results it is necessary that you correctly fill in the "Country Code" on the
upload form. The Country Code is pre-filled as "US" (i.e., United States); if your sightings are from another country
you must change &quot;US&quot; to the correct country code. This must be the two-letter country code that AviSys uses.
If you are not sure what the correct country code is for a Place, do “List Records” for some species that you have seen in that country. The two-letter country code is displayed just to the left of the date.
If you have ever entered data with the incorrect country code, the steps described above under "Repairing Data"
will fix it.</p>
<p><strong>Special cases:</strong> Finally, there are a few special cases that you must be aware of. The country code for the United States of America
is "US". However, AviSys distinguishes among Alaska,  Hawaii, and the Lower 48, so if you have sightings for Alaska, enter "AK" as the 
country code, and if you have sightings for Hawaii, enter "HI" as the country code. 
After taking note of the meaning of these codes, the application will change the country code to "US" before writing
the output file. A second special case involves Russia. If you have sightings from western Russia, enter the country
code as RSW instead of RS. AviSys will then classify the sightings as Western Palearctic. For sightings elsewhere in 
Russia enter the country code as RSE, and AviSys will classify them as Asian.
